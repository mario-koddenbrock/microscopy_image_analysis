# Microscopy Image Analysis

This repository contains tools and models for analyzing microscopy images using vision language and vision models. The project leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide accurate and efficient image analysis.

This work is part of the DFG Project Appl-FM.

## Features

- \*\*Image Segmentation\*\*: Automatically segment microscopy images into meaningful regions.
- \*\*Object Detection\*\*: Detect and classify objects within microscopy images.
- \*\*Image Classification\*\*: Classify microscopy images into predefined categories.


## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

## Usage

### Image Segmentation
#### THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
\`\`\`python
from segmentation import segment_image

image_path = 'path/to/image.png'
segmented_image = segment_image(image_path)
\`\`\`

### Object Detection
#### THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
\`\`\`python
from detection import detect_objects

image_path = 'path/to/image.png'
detections = detect_objects(image_path)
\`\`\`

### Image Classification
#### THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
\`\`\`python
from classification import classify_image

image_path = 'path/to/image.png'
classification = classify_image(image_path)
\`\`\`
